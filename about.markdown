Hey, I’m Dharmanshu Saini—a firmware engineer who loves tinkering with embedded systems and making things work smarter, not harder. Right now, I’m at **Sibros Technologies**, where I spend my days coding in **C++** and **C**, building firmware for microcontrollers, and figuring out how to make **Over-the-Air (OTA) updates** work even on low-end devices. It’s challenging, but I love the puzzle of making tech more efficient and user-friendly.

Before this, I was at **Euler Motors**, where I worked on firmware and bootloaders for electric vehicles. I also had a fun stint as an intern at **StackFusion**, where I got to play around with **IoT** and **RTOS** for automated parking systems. (Yes, I helped make parking a little less annoying!)

I studied **Electronics and Communication** at **NIT Kurukshetra**, and while I was there, I picked up a love for solving real-world problems with code. When I’m not buried in firmware, you’ll probably find me out for a run, lost in a good book, or cruising on my motorcycle.

I’m always up for a good tech chat or a new challenge, so feel free to drop me a line if you want to connect or geek out over embedded systems!
